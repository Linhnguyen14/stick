Country: Vietnam
City: Saigon
Data avaiable at: https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/metro/ho-chi-minh-city_vietnam/
Additional note: Ho Chi Minh is the current name of the city. However, I prefer the name Saigon, therefore I shall use it in my analysis.

The top 1% contributors contribute up to 87% of all contents. And they are human, not bots.

And no, that is a very bad news:
- It's good and all, when the top contributors contribute. But what happened, when they stopped? 
Well, nothing. Nothing happened, because there was no one to make it happened. 
Look at 2010, contributions dropped to almost nothing.

- Open Street Map can be so much more accurate than Google's and Bing's, because it relies on 
"on the ground" volunteers. So it's gonna be hurted the most, when volunteer contributions drop.

- The numbers of volunteers and contributions from non-top-contributors are increasing steadily over the years, 
which is good, but not good enough. The map of Saigon, let alone Vietnam, are still severely lacking.

To remain relevant, OSM Saigon needs more contributors. There are lots of ways:
- Type of contributors: Why relies on human, when you could use machine? We're now in the 
era of robots (delivery bots, both ground and air). We could now employ thousands of flying 
bots to do real-time aerial mapping, world-wide. This, however, also mean that Google's and Bing's 
could do the same thing. And it's gonna be difficult, to prevail against them, given their huge 
advantageous in technology and capital.

- Reduce barriers of entry: No more GPS device, no more pens and paper, now, with just a 
smartphone, and an app, plug-n-play, anyone with a smartphone could become a contributor now.

- Incentives: There are still things that only human could do. So a special incentive system would go a long way:
      + A leader board that honour top contributors.
      + Some sort of personalized page, where people can quote or show off their contributions.

A statistical test employed as part of the effort to study the power of the brain, which is the relationship between
complexity of the information intake (incongruent words) and the speed of process (time it took to call the colour)

Chosen statistical test: Dependent t-test for paired samples, the result suggested that there are enough evidence to
reject the Null hypothesis.

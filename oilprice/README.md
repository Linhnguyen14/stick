This should be the most accurately plot that I could draw. Although this plot could show just how overprice
the Vietnam’s petrol are compared to the US’s, I believe that it is not all there is to it.

There should be additional insights, if we could break through the operation and taxation barriers. There
should be a much wider gap, I believe.

Putting that aside, this plot was able to show that:

• There was a massive gap in petrol price between the 2 country, shown clearly starting from 2012.
• 2012 is the mark, when Vietnam’s petrol price was actively kept well beyond US’s petrol price.
• Before 2012, the Vietnam’s price seems to be in line with the US, sometimes even lower, but let us not
forget, that by default, Petrolimex have an advantage in cost over US’s firm.
• One assumption, is that it all started, with the 2009 crisis, it hit petrolimex hard, and they had to
ramp up the petrol price to make up for the lost incurred by bad investments.

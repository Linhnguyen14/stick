Originally, Vietnam was a net oil exporter. It came to an end by 2010:

• There was a massive gap in petrol price between the 2 country, shown clearly starting from 2012.
• 2012 is the mark, when Vietnam’s petrol price was actively kept well beyond US’s petrol price.

For now, I visualized the price differences. 

In the short future, I will come back, and dig deeper into the transition from a net oil exporter to a 
net oil importer. I suspect that there are some interesting story behind it.
